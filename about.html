<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. I am Sanika here! Nice to see you here.</p>

<p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. 
  As a recent graduate, I have hands-on experience building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
  frameworks like React.js.
   I am also familiar with backend technologies such as Node.js and
    basic database management with MongoDB and MySQL. 
    Eager to contribute to real-world projects, I am committed to continuous learning and excited to grow as a developer in a dynamic and collaborative environment.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking your precious time!</p>
